      %h2 DEBUT ALBUM RELEASE

      %p
        The debut release from the Travis Winters Band features eight original tracks
        that are a delightfully authentic tasting plate of influences; a nod and a wink
        to Tom Waits, shout out to the gritty grooves of Louisiana and Texas, and a
        musical love letter to B.B. King. Travis writes with the lyrical cheek of Rick
        Estrin, Little Charlie and Albert Collins — all troubled by fussy, difficult women!

      %p
        A native Kiwi, a craftsman, and a damn fine drummer Ben brings a
        very relaxed and groovy sensibility to the rhythm section. A love for
        laid back cuts doesn't mean Ben can't rip it when required — the man's on point.

      %p
        A life with the Blues — in one way or another — following in the foot-steps
        of giants; Travis wields a Telecaster like a convict weilds an 8 pound hammer —
        a mighty swing, a ton of force and a thump to keep the time.

      %p
        Class, style and rock solid groove — Craig brings some melodic and funky
        sensibility to the Blues. Fast establishing himself in Melbourne as a sought
        after upright bass player, Craig gets to bring some electric funk to the stage
        with this trio.
